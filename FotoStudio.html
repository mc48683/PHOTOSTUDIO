              <p>We hired Chris for our wedding. 
                From the very beginning he was very professional. 
                He was very flexible when we changed our date and also when we arranged our engagement 
                shoot as we had to change it due to bad weather. He was very calm and easy to talk to. 
                On the day he was on time and very discreet. He took some beautiful photos of us both in church and at the venue. 
                Our celebrant commented that he was one of the best photographer he's ever worked with because of how discreet he was. 
                It rained quite a lot on the day which meant that we could not take pictures when and where we had planned but he adapted 
                to the circumstances brilliantly and we have a variety of formal and candid shots to remember the day by. 
                He was truly brilliant!! He was also very quick at editing the photos which we have on an online gallery and in a USB 
                stick as well as getting us a beautiful folio box with some prints. His prices are also very reasonable for wedding photography. 
                We would definitely recommend him!</p>

              <p>Zoe was the first vendor we locked down for our city hall wedding - if you read her website at all, you'll know she's meticulous,
                 detailed-oriented,¸
                 and will help you feel confident planning from afar if you're not a local.
                  Zoe always responded quickly and provided tips for the wedding which ended up coming true 
                  (always aim to have hair and makeup done earlier than you think). She even brainstormed alternative 
                  plans with me for backup ceremony locations if city hall were closed due to the pandemic or if we couldn't get the date 
                  we wanted and helped me coordinate a surprise for the groom. Having Zoe was like having a wedding planner and she kept us 
                  moving to each shoot location like a well-oiled machine.
                I loved that she did a mix of candid style and posed shots and we didn't need to repeat poses and could just focus on being together 
                and with our friends. She made excellent use of time when we stepped away to check in for city hall (only the couple and witness were
                 allowed in this area) and she did a mini photo session for our friends on the grand staircase which was a pleasant surprise when we got 
                 our pictures!
                I love looking back on the pictures because she captured genuine smiles and laughter. I'm also glad we increased the amount of photography 
                time even though it was a small affair at city hall so we could have Zoe with us from getting ready to the start of dinner.</p>

              <p>There just aren’t enough words to possibly describe how amazing each and every photo that taryn snaps.
                 She has a magical way of finding the perfect angle, lighting and of course expressions.
                 My partner and I did a two-part wedding, a small family-only ceremony at SF City Hall followed a few months later by 
                 a reception in Oakland. We worked with one of Zoe's associate photographers (Marielle) both times and have had
                  an amazing experience working with them. Marielle brought so much warmth to our photo sessions and helped to make 
                  us feel comfortable and make the photoshoot a memorable and fun experience. The photos we've gotten so far have been incredible, 
                 and we love how Zoe has a guide for EVERYTHING!</p>
